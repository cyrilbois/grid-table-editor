# Text Editing

The data in the text area is configured by choosing a specific tab format e.g. selecting `Markdown` will show the grid data in Markdown format, selecting `CSV` will show the grid data as Comma Separated Values.

It is possible to edit data in this text area.

When all edits are complete, click the `^ Set Grid From Text ^` button and the contents of the text area will be loaded into the data grid.

> *Warning* The text area defaults to showing data from the Data Grid. If you edit the data in the text area and change tabs then any changes you made will be lost because the new tab will show the data in the grid formatted to the chosen format. If you want to keep any changes then `Set the Grid From Text`.
