# Importing from Files

The set of tabs `Markdown | CSV | JSON` etc. configure the current import and export format.

To import from a particular file format:

- choose the tab for a particular format e.g. `Markdown`
- click the `Choose file` button
- choose a Markdown file to load

The data will then be loaded into the Data Grid for editing via the grid, and shown in the text area for text editing.

## Drag And Drop Import

Once a file format tab has been selected it is also possible to drag and drop a file on to the GUI to start an import.

e.g. if `CSV` tab is chosen then the Drop Zone will read `[Drag And Drop .csv File Here]`, allowing you to drag and drop a file to this area to trigger an import.
