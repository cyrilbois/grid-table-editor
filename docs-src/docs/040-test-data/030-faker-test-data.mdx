# Faker Data Generation

[Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/) is a test data generation library for JavaScript.

This is used by the tool to generate 'typed' data i.e. non-regex based data.

The values shown in the 'type' drop down menu match the values in the Faker.js API.

## Read The Faker API Docs

I recommend using Faker API documentation to understand some of the test data generation functions.

https://fakerjs.dev/api/address.html

Most of the Faker API is implemented.

e.g. I can add a column called "first name" and generate values using faker by using the "name.firstName" function.

Listed in the API here: https://fakerjs.dev/api/name.html#firstName

## Create Test Data Schema as Text then Edit in Grid

I tend to use the "Test Data Text Schema" text input to create an initial schema.

e.g.

```
first name
a
last name
b
email
e
address
a
```

And then edit in the grid to pick the faker api functions from the pop up list in the editor.

## Use the Fake Function to join Faker API functinos

We support the use of the 'fake' function in Faker.

The `fake` function makes it easy to combine text and Faker calls into a single string.

https://fakerjs.dev/api/fake.html

e.g. we can use `fake` in a schema to create an address:

```
address
fake {{address.buildingNumber}} {{address.streetName}}
```

## Copy Schemas For Re-use
And because the schema text field is just a text field, I can copy the schema into Evernote and re-use it later to generate more data:

```
first name
name.firstName
last name
name.lastName
email
internet.email
address
fake {{address.buildingNumber}} {{address.streetName}}
```
