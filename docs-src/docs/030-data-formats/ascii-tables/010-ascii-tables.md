## What are Ascii Tables

Ascii Tables are a traditional way of representing data for Text Files or from Typewriters or early printers.

They have remained popular because they can be embedded in Program code in comments to help describe data.

e.g.

```
+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------+-------------+
|    Country    |  Population   | Yearly Change | Net Change | World Share |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------+-------------+
| China         | 1,439,323,776 | 0.39 %        | 5,540,090  | 18.47 %     |
| India         | 1,380,004,385 | 0.99 %        | 13,586,631 | 17.70 %     |
| United States | 331,002,651   | 0.59 %        | 1,937,734  | 4.25 %      |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+------------+-------------+
```

This is often more readable than an equivalent Markdown table because it is formatted purely for output and for readability.
