# Faker Data Generation

[Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/) is a test data generation library for JavaScript.

This is used by the tool to generate 'typed' data i.e. non-regex based data.

The values shown in the 'type' drop down menu match the values in the Faker.js API.

> Note: The full API of Faker may not be available as we may not have upgraded to the most up to date version of Faker yet.
