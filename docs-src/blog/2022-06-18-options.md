Can now control HTML output.

<!--truncate-->

## HTML Options

I've added options to the HTML output now so it is possible to:

- compact the HTML
- pretty print html to add indentation
- control the pretty print indentation characters
- add tbody and thead elements

## Refactoring and Testing

In addition, there have been a tonne of internal refactorings and bug fixes to make the code more streamlined and make it easier to add new export and import options in the future.
