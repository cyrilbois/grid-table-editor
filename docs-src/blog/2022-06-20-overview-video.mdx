import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Released an overview video of Faker Functionality.

<!--truncate-->

I added a new page to the documentation with some Faker tips. Proper documentation will be coming soon.

- https://anywaydata.com/docs/videos/faker-test-data

This explains how to use Faker, and the approach I use when creating test data.
