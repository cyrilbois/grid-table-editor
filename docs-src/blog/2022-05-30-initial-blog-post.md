Initial Release of docs.

<!--truncate-->

I've been busy refactoring the code of the [Data Table Editor](https://github.com/eviltester/grid-table-editor/)

- to make it more modular
- add unit tests
- add documentation

This should make the application more robust and easier to use.

It is still hosted on Gitpages, but if more people use the app then I'll setup a domain for it.

Currently web traffic is tracked using plausible.io and no data is passed to the server other than counts of page views.
