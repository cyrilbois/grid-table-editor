## Ascii Tables

Output Ascii Tables can be useful for writing tabular content in emails, code or generally making notes in text files.

e.g.

```
+----------+----------+----------------------------+
|   test   |   name   |           email            |
+----------+----------+----------------------------+
| 41211470 | Cyril    | Tianna_Kris@gmail.com      |
|  4199130 | Andreane | Isac.Mills92@gmail.com     |
|  9258363 | Mariam   | Abner_Feeney82@hotmail.com |
| 93931922 | Desiree  | Josh48@yahoo.com           |
+----------+----------+----------------------------+
```

_Note: Data in table above was generated by the faker test generation in the tool_

> The schema used for the data table was:
>
```
test
[0-9]{3,10}
name
name.firstName
email
internet.email
```

## Ascii Table Libraries

There are a variety of libraries available to support in this, and I listed [a few in the docs](https://anywaydata.com/docs/misc/related_tools#ascii-tables)

I initially tried [Ascii-Table](https://github.com/sorensen/ascii-table) this was very easy to import from a CDN and I was able to create a prototype very quickly. I thought it lacked some of the more advanced configuration I was looking for and didn't think I'd be able to support as many export formats as I'd like e.g. reStructuredText

So I moved on to [Ascii-Table3](https://github.com/AllMightySauron/ascii-table3) which has the very useful feature of being able to create styles to set a lot of configuration very quickly, it also allows more detailed configuration of the borders for the table.

The problem here was that Ascii-Table3 is really designed for server side usage and has a requirement on a file system library to import styles. To get something working quickly I amended the import mechanism to allow it to work in the browser. This is an unofficial port with the code being available in the [github repo](https://github.com/eviltester/grid-table-editor/tree/master/js/libs/ascii-table3).

The styles feature of Ascii-Table3 allowed me to add a drop down on the GUI to select different styles of tables without too much development effort.
